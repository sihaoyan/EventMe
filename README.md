# EventMe

This is an instruction on how to run EventMe on an emulator. This is a project accomplished by Sihao Yang, Cecilia Lliu, and Lily Qi. I just copied it from the original git repository for convenience: https://github.com/Lily-Qi/EventMe. I was responsible for the map feature, including locations, markers, route planning, bottom sheet, and also some sorting functions used elsewhere.  

## Select Emulator
We developed it on Android Studio and you can run it on Android Studio by setting up an emulator.
